# QR_code-generator-npm-
This is a QR code generator using the npm packages.

I used packages like inquirer, fs, and qr-image.
It creates a QR PNG after the user specifies the URL he wants to put inside that PNG.
Mostly people can use this code to create QR PNGs for their projects and attach it to the project folder so they can directly access.

use these links to understand the concept behind:
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer"><strong>npm inquirer</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image"><strong>npm qr-image</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra"><strong>npm fs-extra</strong></a></li>

Do Code, Be Happy...
