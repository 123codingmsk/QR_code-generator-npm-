# QR_code-generator-npm-
This is a QR code generator using the npm packages.

I used packages like inquirer, fs, and qr-image.

<strong>u need to install these packages using the terminal so that other modules will be added to your project folder..</strong>

It creates a QR PNG after the user specifies the URL he wants to put inside that PNG.
Most people can use this code to create QR PNGs for their projects and attach them to the project folder so they can access them directly.

use these links to understand the concept behind:
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer"><strong>npm inquirer</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image"><strong>npm qr-image</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra"><strong>npm fs-extra</strong></a></li>

Do Code, Be Happy...
